//! Compatibility layer for converting between op-alloy 0.20.0 and 0.21.0 types
//!
//! This module provides conversions between the two versions of op-alloy types
//! that are currently in use due to reth v1.8.2 depending on 0.20.0 while
//! we want to use 0.21.0 in our public API.
//!
//! The strategy is to use reth's re-exported types (v0.20.0) when interacting
//! with reth APIs, and provide conversion functions when needed.
